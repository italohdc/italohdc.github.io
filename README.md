## Functionalities

This project has some implementations over the Jekyll Now theme (as Jekyll Now must be kept very simple and useful for general purposes, thus some functionalities that I wanted were missing).

These are some of these implementations:

- New include macro to add images (with caption  and float options)
- Easily add thumbnail on blog post (this thumbnail is shown on the posts list and as meta tags, when shared in social network)

This website is responsive and has a mobile version:
