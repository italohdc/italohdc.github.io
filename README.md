# My Personal Website

This is my personal blog hosted on GitHub Pages. It's based on the theme [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and is distributed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Functionalities

This project has some implementations over the Jekyll Now theme (as Jekyll Now must be kept very simple and useful for general purposes, thus some functionalities that I wanted were missing).

These are some of these functionalities:

- Include macro to add images (with caption and float options)
- Easily add thumbnail on blog post (this thumbnail is shown on the posts list and as meta tags, when shared on social network)

This website is responsive and has a mobile version:
