Undergraduate Engineering Student at the **Federal University of Minas Gerais** ([UFMG {% include fa-icon.html id="university" %}](https://ufmg.br/international-visitors)), competed in several robotics competitions, either national and international. Devoted to programming, is learning about Artificial Inteligence and Applied Robotics.

### 2017

* **2nd Place** on AbbVie Hackathon
* Lecture about IoT (Internet of Things) on BH-TEC

{% include image.html file="about-me/2017-iot-talk-bhtec.jpg" float=true description="Lecture about IoT" %}

In the Campus Party we developed a mockup of an app to help the citizens keep track of their medical appointments and were awarded the 2nd place on the AbbVie Hackathon.

Taking place in the Technological Park of Belo Horizonte, I presented a lecture about some [low-cost platforms to develop to the Internet of Things](https://www.slideshare.net/ItaloLelis1/novas-plataformas-de-baixo-custo-para-a-internet-das-coisas). Amongst the presented topics: Raspberry Pi, ESP8266, MQTT, LORA Network, PlatformIO, Android Things.

### 2016

* 9th Place on RoboCup Germany

{% include image.html file="about-me/2016-rc001.jpg" float=true description="RoboCup 2016 - Germany" %}

For the **Rescue Maze** competition, we developed a robot capable of travelling a maze and returning, in an optimal way, to its original point. For that, was used **Tremaux** to explore the labirinth and [**A* Algorithm**](https://italohdc.github.io/posts/maze-solving) to compute the optimal way.

### 2015

* **1st Place** on Latin American Robotics Competition

We were **three-time champion** in consecutive years for the Rescue Maze on the Latin American Competition.

### 2014

* **1st Place** on Latin American Robotics Competition
* **3rd Place** on RoboCup Brazil
* Development of **Assistive Belt for Visually Impaired**

{% include image.html file="about-me/2014-febrace.jpg" float=true description="FEBRACE 2014" %}

Taking place in SÃ£o Paulo, we presented in the USP Science Fair ([FEBRACE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7VL8v_2wdo)) an **Assistive Belt** intented to aid Visually Impaired people in their mobility. The device had three ultrasonics sensors to measure the environment and return haptic feedback to the user.

In the RoboCup, we developed a robot capable of travelling a maze in the Rescue Maze competition and awarded the 3rd Place in the worldwide competition. To achieve the objective, the Tremaux algorithm was used.

### 2013

* **1st Place** on Latin American Robotics Competition
* **2nd Place** on RoboCup Netherlands

{% include image.html file="about-me/2013-rc001.jpg" float=true description="RoboCup 2013 - Netherlands" %}

In the Rescue Maze competition, an autonomous robot was developed in order to travel an entire maze looking for heat victims attached to the wall. After travelling the entire maze, the robot receives a bonus if it goes back to its start position. To travel the maze, the **Tremaux algorithm** was used and the actual position of the robot was saved in a Cartesian system.

### 2012

* **5th Place** on RoboCup Mexico

In Mexico, we participated in a competition in which we should develop a robot capable of following a line and avoiding obstacles. To follow the line, the robot read the environment with light sensors and applied a simplified **PID controller** to keep the robot centered in the line. The hardware was developed using the microcontroller **Arduino**.
