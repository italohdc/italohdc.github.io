* 9th Place on RoboCup Germany

For the **Rescue Maze** competition, we developed a robot capable of travelling a maze and returning, in an optimal way, to its original point. For that, was used **Tremaux** to explore the labirinth and [**A* Algorithm**](https://italohdc.github.io/posts/maze-solving) to compute the optimal way.

### 2014

* **1st Place** on Latin American Robotics Competition
* **3rd Place** on RoboCup Brazil
* Development of **Assistive Belt for Visually Impaired**

We developed a robot capable of travelling a maze in the Rescue Maze competition and awarded the 3rd Place in the worldwide competition. For the robot, the Tremaux algorithm was used.

Taking place in São Paulo, we presented in the USP Science Fair an **Assistive Belt** intented to aid Visually Impaired people in their mobility. The device had three ultrasonics sensors to measure the environment and return haptic feedback to the user.

### 2013

* **1st Place** on Latin American Robot Competition
* **2nd Place** on RoboCup Netherlands

In that competition, an autonomous robot was developed in order to travel an entire maze looking for heat victims attached to the wall. After travelling the entire maze, the robot receives a bonus if it goes back to its start position.

### 2012

* **6th Place** on RoboCup Mexico
