Aiming to participate in the [RoboCup](http://www.robocup.org/) [Rescue Maze](http://rcj.robocup.org/rcj2016/rescue_maze_2016.pdf) competition, we developed a robot capable of travelling a maze. The robot initially didn't know it's location nor the map of the environment. After going through all the maze, the robot mapped the labirint and was capable of coming back to its initial position in an optimal way. For that last function, was used the **A* Search Algorithm**.

To make it easy to develop the A* Algorithm, a virtual environment was set using [**Processing**](http://processing.org/). The robot was then emulated in a two-dimensional maze.

The **A\* Search Algorithm** shows the best route to move from a point A to a point B. You can see more about the A\* Search Algorithm in the book [_Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) by _Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig_.
